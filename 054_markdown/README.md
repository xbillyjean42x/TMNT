# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. 

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```

``` css
body {
    background-color:#464646;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-position: left;
    background-size: cover;
}
