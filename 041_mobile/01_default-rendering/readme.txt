"To attempt to provide the best experience, mobile browsers will render the page at a desktop screen width (usually about 980px, though this varies across devices), and then try to make the content look better by increasing font sizes and scaling the content to fit the screen. For users, this means that font sizes may appear inconsistently and they have to double-tap or pinch-to-zoom in order to see and interact with the content."
