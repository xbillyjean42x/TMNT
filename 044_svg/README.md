# Important

If you are having issues with SVGs not displaying, or an error that says "file URLs are treated as unique security origins", you need to run your code from a server.

In the video, I am running my code from webstorm's server.

For your SVG code to work in all browsers, you will need some server to serve your code.

Alternatively, you can try a different browser.

At the time of this writing, the code ran fine in firefox without a server.

You can use https://rawgit.com/ to serve your pages

Push your code to github, then grab the url at github for your index.html page, then drop that into rawgit, then grab the url from rawgit for development, and then take a look at your work.
