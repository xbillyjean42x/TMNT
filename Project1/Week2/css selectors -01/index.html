<p>I hate my job's website layout. It drives me nuts because it's not informative enough and doesn't offer tax payers enough information.
And to find things on the site is ridiculous. Links are within paragraphs of texts when a person wants to find more information instead of on the left panel for easy selection. We pay for this crap. Tax payer's dollars at its best.
